# TODO
- [ ] `MONTHLY <amount>` should prorate (e.g. $500 on a 30 day month should
      give you $16.67 per day, not the whole value all at once)
- [ ] There should be an option (off by default?) of a daily balance reminder
      or reminder whenever the balance changes (which is at least daily,
      because we're pro-rating the budget amount)
